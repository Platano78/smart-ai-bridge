## 1. Plan: Integrate Dashboard & Conversation Threading into MKG v2

**Problem**: Model swapping currently requires editing multiple source files manually. A WebUI dashboard and conversation threading existed in `smart-ai-bridge` but fell off during the v2 refactor.

## What Exists...

**Files**: server-mkg-v2.js, src/handlers/system-handlers.js, package.json, src/dashboard/index.js, src/dashboard/public/index.html
